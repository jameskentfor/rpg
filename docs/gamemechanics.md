Game Mechanics
---
 
 - Turn Based? 
    - I don't really want it to be JRPG style
    - would rather have it be more of a crpg
    - Disco Elysium/Pillars of Eternity style 
    - More focused on the story/aesthetic/art/music than having super complex gameplay

 - Gameplay
    - Prerendered world
    - minimal combat
    - scavenging for electronics to fix something

 - Attribute System?
    - Attributes
        - Strength
        - Constitution
        - Dexterity
        - Intelligence
        - Wisdom
        - Charisma
    - Attributes should affect the outcomes of situations
        - for example, the player is faced with an anomoly and needs to sneak by it. Agility attribute should affect what the outcome is.
        - or if faced with an enemy, the player should be able to choose to sneak or attack and attribute will affect the outcome.

Graphics

 - Pre Rendered 3D Scenes
    - Hand/Digitally Drawn?
    - Snapshot of Blender scene?

 - More detailed close ups of characters and items during dialogue/interaction
    - like fallout 1 or felidek
